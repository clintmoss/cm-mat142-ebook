  <h1>1.1 Basic Concepts</h1>
  <h2>Learning Objectives:</h2>
  <p>Upon completion of this section, you should be able to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the population of a study</li>
    <li>Determine whether a value calculated from a group is a statistic or a parameter</li>
    <li>Determine whether a measurement is categorical (qualitative) or quantitative data</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Populations and Samples</h2>
  <p>We are usually interested in understanding a measurement or observation for a specific group of people. This group (whether it is people, animals, plants, etc...) along with what is being measured is known as the <strong>population</strong> of interest, or simply the population. The population is the collection of all people who have some characteristic in common; it can be as broad as "all people" if we have a very general research question about human psychology, or it can be extremely narrow, such as "all nursing majors at Pima Community College" if we have a more specific group in mind. The challenge with studying the group as a whole is that it may not be possible to examine each member from the population and collect data from them due to costs and time requirements to do so. When we have this situation we often must collect a smaller part of the population, called a <strong>sample</strong>. If we are able to collect the entire population we call that a <strong>census</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank" >Pew Research Center</a> asked 1000 women in the U.S. what their highest attained education level was.</p>
    <p>What is the Population? What is the Sample?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Population: The set of highest education levels of all women in the U.S.</p>
    <p>Sample: The set of highest education level of 1000 women in the U.S.</p>

    <h3>Common Factors</h3>
    <p> A factor shared by two or more numbers, common factors are numbers that divide exactly into two different numbers.</p>

  <p>Before we begin gathering and analyzing data we need to characterize the population we are studying. If we want to study the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical first-year college student, our population might be all first-year students at your college.  Or it might be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All first-year community college students in the state of Washington.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>All first-year students at public colleges and universities in the state of Washington.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the state of Washington.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the entire United  States.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>And so on.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="border">
    <h4>Population, Sample, Census</h4>
    <p>The <strong>population</strong> is the group the collected data is intended to describe.</p>
    <p>A <strong>sample</strong> is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that fairly representative of the whole population.</p>
    <p>A <strong>census</strong> is a survey of an entire population.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Sometimes the intended population is called the <strong>target population</strong>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.</p>
  <p>Why is it important to specify the population?&nbsp; We might get different answers to our question as we vary the population we are studying.&nbsp; First-year students at the University of Arizona might take slightly more diverse courses than those at your college, and some of these courses may require less popular textbooks that cost more; or, on the other hand, the University Bookstore might have a larger pool of used textbooks, reducing the cost of these books to the students.&nbsp; Whichever the case (and it is likely that some combination of&nbsp;these and other factors are in play), the data we gather from your college will probably not be the same as that from the University of Arizona.&nbsp; Particularly when conveying our results to others, we want to be clear about the population we are describing with our data.</p>
