  <h1>6.4 Problem Solving</h1>
  <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
  <p>Upon completion of this section, you should be able to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply Problem Solving Strategies to Applications</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Apply Problem Solving Process and Strategies</h2>
  <p>In Chapter 0 you were introduced to some fundamental ideas for problems solving strategies based on the work from Polya. Below is a quick summary.</p>
  <div class="definition">
    <h4>Problem Solving Process</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand the Problem</li>
      <li>Devise a Plan</li>
      <li>Carry out the Plan</li>
      <li>Look Back</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Let us now look at applications that take into consideration the topics we covered in this course.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title">
      <h3>Example 1</h3>
      <p>Joseph is remoldeling a kitchen and received a quote for installation and labor of a new floor to be $105 per sq yard (this includes taxes). The kitchen has dimensions of 22 ft 5 in by 15 ft. In addition Jospeh will purchase a new Refridgerator for $2,900, range for $1,300, and a dishwasher for $899 at a local store (where sales tax is 8.7%).</p>
      <p>Joseph needs to finance this remodeling project. At the local bank he can get a line of credit with an annual rate of 7% with monthly payments with a 5 year term. Determine the total cost of the remodel, the payments for the loan, the cost of the loan, and the total cost of the remodel if payments are made as scheduled. </p>

  <p>The problem above illustrates what really can be involved as we look at a general application of material you have worked on. We needed an understanding of how to convert units, find the area, determines sales tax, and find the payment amount on an amortized loan.</p>
