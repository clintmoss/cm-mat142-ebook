    <h2>Populations and Samples</h2>
    <p><a href="http://youtu.be/NlcDpqnqBKY" target="_blank" >Video Introduction to Population and Sample</a> (CC)</p>
    <p>We are usually interested in understanding a measurement or observation for a specific group of people. This group (whether it is people, animals, plants, etc...) along with what is being measured is known as the <strong>population</strong> of interest, or simply the population. The population is the collection of all people who have some characteristic in common; it can be as broad as “all people” if we have a very general research question about human psychology, or it can be extremely narrow, such as “all nursing majors at Pima Community College” if we have a more specific group in mind. The challenge with studying the group as a whole is that it may not be possible to examine each member from the population and collect data from them due to costs and time requirements to do so. When we have this situation we often must collect a smaller part of the population, called a <strong>sample</strong>. If we are able to collect the entire population we call that a <strong>census</strong>.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 1</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank" >Pew Research Center</a> asked 1000 women in the U.S. what their highest attained education level was.</p>
      <p>What is the Population? What is the Sample?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>Population: The set of highest education levels of all women in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Sample: The set of highest education level of 1000 women in the U.S.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Before we begin gathering and analyzing data we need to characterize the <strong>population</strong> we are studying. If we want to study the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical first-year college student, our population might be all first-year students at your college.&nbsp; Or it might be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All first-year community college students in the state of Washington.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>All first-year students at public colleges and universities in the state of Washington.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the state of Washington.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the entire United  States.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>And so on.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="definition">
      <h4>Population, Sample, Census</h4>
      <p>The <strong>population</strong> is the group the collected data is intended to describe.</p>
      <p>A <strong>sample</strong> is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that fairly representative of the whole population.</p>
      <p>A <strong>census</strong> is a survey of an entire population.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Sometimes the intended population is called the <strong>target population</strong>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.</p>
    <p>Why is it important to specify the population?&nbsp; We might get different answers to our question as we vary the population we are studying.&nbsp; First-year students at the University of Arizona might take slightly more diverse courses than those at your college, and some of these courses may require less popular textbooks that cost more; or, on the other hand, the University Bookstore might have a larger pool of used textbooks, reducing the cost of these books to the students.&nbsp; Whichever the case (and it is likely that some combination of&nbsp;these and other factors are in play), the data we gather from your college will probably not be the same as that from the University of Arizona.&nbsp; Particularly when conveying our results to others, we want to be clear about the population we are describing with our data.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 2</h3>
      <p>We are interested in examining how many years it took on average to earn a Bachelors Degree by looking at graduating seniors at American colleges and universities. The entire graduating class from UofA was examined to determine the average number of years.</p>
      <p>What is the intended target population? What is the real population?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>While the target (intended) population may have been all graduating seniors of American colleges and university, the real population of the survey is only graduating seniors from UofA. This would be considered a census of the graduating seniors from UofA as all students were examined.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 3</h3>
      <p>A newspaper website contains a poll asking the local people in the city their opinion on a recent news article.</p>
      <p>What is the intended target population of this poll? What is the real population of this poll?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>While the target (intended) population may have been all people in the area, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tryitnow">
      <h3>Try it Now 1</h3>
      <p>To determine the average length of trout in a lake, researchers catch 20 fish and measure them. What is the sample and population in this study?</p>
      <h4 class="js-expandmore"> Hint 1 </h4>
      <div class="js-to-expand">
        <p>The <strong>population</strong> of a study is the group the collected data is intended to describe.</p>
        <p>A <strong>sample</strong> is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that fairly representative of the whole population.</p>
      </div>
      <h4 class="js-expandmore"> Answer </h4>
      <div class="js-to-expand">
        <p>The sample is the 20 fish caught. The  population is all fish in the lake. The sample may be somewhat unrepresentative of the population since not all fish  may be large enough to catch the bait.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Paramenter and Statistic</h2>
    <p>If we were able to gather data on every member of our population, say the average (we will define &quot;average&quot; more carefully in a subsequent section) amount of money spent on textbooks by each first-year student at your college during the last academic year, the resulting number would be called a <strong>parameter</strong>. The problem with trying to gather that information is that it will be very costly in terms of money and time to reach every student and get the total spent. Instead what we may do instead of take a sample from the first-year students and calculate that average just from the sample. The resulting number from the sample would be called a <strong>statistic</strong>.</p>
    <div class="definition">
      <h4>Parameter and Statistic</h4>
      <p>A <strong>parameter</strong> is a measurement or value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using all the data from a population</p>
      <p>A <strong>statistic</strong> is a measurement or value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using the data from a sample.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To help remember the difference remember that a <strong>P</strong>arameter is a value from a <strong>P</strong>opulation and a <strong>S</strong>tatistic is a value from a <strong>S</strong>ample (the first letters correspond).</p>
    <p>For very large population we seldom have a value of a parameter, since surveying an entire population is usually very time-consuming and expensive. This is really where the area of statistics was formed as it gives us the tools to describe that unknown population parameter by using a well designed sample to find a statistic to give us an estimate of the parameter. Being able to identify the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic while reading studies is important as we know population parameter are a fixed value for that moment in time of the study while a statistic can change based on different samples from that same population.</p>
    <p>We will discuss sampling methods in greater detail in the next section. For now, let us assume that samples are chosen in an appropriate manner.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 4</h3>
      <p>A researcher wanted to know how citizens of Tucson felt about a voter initiative. To study this, she goes to the Park Place Mall and randomly selects 500 shoppers and asks them their opinion. 60% indicate they are supportive of the initiative. What is the sample and population? Is the 60% value a parameter or a statistic?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>The sample is the 500 shoppers questioned. The population is less clear. While the intended population of this survey was Tucson citizens, the effective population was mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that the 500 shoppers questioned would be representative of all Tucson citizens.</p>
      <p>The 60% value was based on the sample, so it is a statistic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 5</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329723/americans-remain-largely-dissatisfied-gun-laws.aspx" target="_blank" >2021 Gallup poll</a> of 547 adults aged 18 and older living in the U.S. found that 42% of the respondents are satisfied with nation's gun laws and 56% dissatisfied. Is the 42% a parameter or a statistic?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>The 42% would represent a statistic as it is a value calculated from a sample.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tryitnow">
      <h3>Try it Now 2</h3>
      <p>A college reports that the average age of their students is 28 years old.&nbsp; Is this a statistic or a parameter?</p>
      <h5 class="js-expandmore"> Hint 1 </h5>
      <div class="js-to-expand">
        <p>A <strong>parameter</strong> is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using all the data from a population</p>
        <p>A <strong>statistic</strong> is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using the data from a sample.</p>
      </div>
      <h5 class="js-expandmore"> Answer </h5>
      <div class="js-to-expand">
        <p>This is a parameter, since the college would have access to data on all students  (the population) </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Categorizing Data</h2>
    <p><a href="http://youtu.be/mxZqyB01qPY" target="_blank" >Video Introduction to Catagorizing Data</a> (CC)</p>
    <p>Once we have gathered data, we need to classify it on certain properties to know what types of tools we can use to analyze the data. The two types of classifications we are going to look at breaks the data into values we can do direct calculations on (like taking an average) or not. We call the classifications as categorical (qualitative) data or quantitative data. If you continue on to further statistics material after this text you may find there are more sub classifications  you can apply as well.</p>
    <div class="definition">
      <h4>Quantitative and categorical data</h4>
      <p><strong>Categorical (qualitative) data</strong> are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects under investigation into various categories.</p>
      <p><strong>Quantitative data</strong> are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful arithmetic calculations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 6</h3>
      <p>We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that each person in a math class saw in a movie theater. Is this data categorical or quantitative?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: <em>Frozen II</em>, <em>Black Panther</em>, or <em>Jurassic World</em>.&nbsp; We might count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like &quot;<em>Finding Nemo</em>.&quot;&nbsp; This would be categorical data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 7</h3>
      <p>A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). Is this data categorical or quantitative?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>This would be quantitative data as they are numbers and adding the values would make sense.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 104 minutes, ...) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $7.75, $9, ...).</p>
    <p>Sometimes, determining whether or not data is categorical or quantitative can be a bit trickier.&nbsp; </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 8</h3>
      <p>Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. Is this data categorical or quantitative?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful mathematical calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 85005 is &quot;500 less than&quot; 85711&nbsp;&mdash; that's like saying that Phoenix, AZ is &quot;500 less than&quot; Tucson, AZ, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example 9</h3>
      <p>A survey about the movie you most recently attended includes the question &quot;How would you rate the movie you just saw?&quot; with these possible answers: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>it was awful</li>
        <li>it was just OK</li>
        <li>I liked it</li>
        <li>it was great </li>
        <li>best movie ever! </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Is this data categorical or quantitative?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but we can't really do any calculations with them: a movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; if two people see the movie and one of them thinks it stinks and the other thinks it's the best ever it doesn't necessarily make sense to say that &quot;on average they liked it.&quot;</p>
      <p>There are cases where data like this where we can order the values may be treated like quantitative results. Examples of this would be rating systems like you see on Amazon and other sites for which reviews are made of a product. The problem is that going from five star to four star may not be a large jump, but somebody going from three stars to star may be more extreme in their feeling of the product. The rating system can't properly judge those difference and averages of these values may not be appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <p>As we study movie-going habits and preferences, we shouldn't forget to specify the population under consideration.&nbsp; If we survey 3-7 year-olds the runaway favorite might be <em>Finding Nemo</em>.&nbsp; 13-17 year-olds might prefer <em>Terminator 3</em>.&nbsp; And 33-37 year-olds might prefer...well, <em>Finding Nemo</em>.</p>
    <div class="tryitnow"> <h3>Try it Now 3</h3>
      <p>Classify each measurement as categorical or quantitative</p>
