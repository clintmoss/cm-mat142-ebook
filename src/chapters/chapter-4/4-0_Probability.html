<h1>Chapter 4 - Probability</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter you will be introduced to the world of counting (or <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics" target="_blank" >combinatorics</a>) and<a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability" target="_blank" > probability.</a> This is the world that
  describes chance and liklihood of events (like the chances of getting a full house in a game of poker or a
  drivers risk of getting into an accident). Casinos are an obvious example of a business that depends on
  probability, but did you know that your insurance companies depend on probabilities to determine your rate?
  Governments apply probabilistic methods when determining policy about energy, environments, and budgeting. The
  world around you relies on understanding the chances of an event occurring to make decisions. </p>
<p>Historically the human race has been playing games with probability (and gambling) for over 5000 years (<a
          href="https://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-040-457-C" target="_blank" >reference</a>). The
  study of probability began earlier than <a href="http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/Figures.htm#pas"
          target="_blank" >Pascal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat"
          target="_blank" >Fermat</a>, but they are the ones that get the credit for bringing attention to the study
  through their own discussions in the mid 1600's. Their work (with countless others) is what allowed for not only
  the study of counting and probability, but also gave birth to the field of <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics" target="_blank" >statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Just for fun before you get started - the Monty Hall Problem is a rather famous for stumping a good number of
  mathematicians when it appeared in an article in the American Statistician in 1975 and later in Parade magazine
  in the 1990s. It is based upon a game played on the game show <em>Let's Make a Deal</em> (with host <a
          href="http://www.biography.com/articles/Monty-Hall-9542238" target="_blank" >Monty Hall</a>). Read about the
  history of this problem at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"
          target="_blank" >Wikipedia</a>. Here is the description of the Monty Hall Problem from Marilyn vos Savant's
  "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine:</p>
<div class="plainblock">
<p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No.&nbsp;1 [but the door is not opened], and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No.&nbsp;3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to stay with your current door or would you like to pick door No.&nbsp;2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
  </div>

<p>What do you think? Does it matter on the choice? Watch the video below to reveal the correct choice.<br>
