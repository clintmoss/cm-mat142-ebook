      <h1>Chapter 5 - Finance</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This chapter is to help you understand some of the mathematics behind personal finances. This will not be a
        complete coverage of many of the topics related to personal finance, but should act as a guide in introducing
        you how savings accounts work to calculate the interest earned, finding the value of saving a fixed deposit
        monthly over a long time period, and calculating loan payments on a car or home mortgage. </p>
      <p>We have to work with money every day.&nbsp; While balancing your checkbook or calculating your monthly
        expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving, planning for retirement, or need a
        loan, we need more mathematics.&nbsp; </p>
